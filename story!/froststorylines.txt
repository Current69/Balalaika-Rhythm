1. Once upon a time, there lived a poor girl named Marfa.Her mother fell ill and passed away. Her father was too old to work. He had to marry someone with money.The wife he chose was very cruel. She had two daughters herself, and they were equally as wretched.

---------------

2. “Scrub the floors, you filthy swine!”“Make my bed and wash my clothes!”“Fix us supper! And it better taste good this time!”Such was Marfa’s harsh reality. She would work all day and cry all night.


-----------------

3. One day, the stepmother grew disgusted by the sight of Marfa’s face.“I must get rid of her somehow,” she thought.Just then, an idea came to her. She rushed to her husband to tell him.“Dear husband, I believe it is time for your daughter to marry.”

------------------

4. The father was thrilled. Anything to get poor Marfa away from this horrid woman!“Tell me, how may I be of assistance?”“Tomorrow morning you must take her deep into the forest and leave her there. For her suitor, Frost, will arrive to claim her as his bride.”

-------------------

5.  The expession of the father’s face quickly  faded from excited to disturbed. “Frost?”“Think about it! He owns the trees, grass, and mountains! Marfa is a lucky girl to marry into such wealth.”The stepmother snickered at her own devious plan. There was no arguing with this woman. He had to obey.

--------------------

6. The next day, Marfa and her father drove on a sledge to the deep forest.“You must wait here for Frost,” the father said. “You are not to leave, I will come back to see you in the morning.”The daughter waited and shivered. Hours passed, snowflakes fell, the cold bit at her skin until she could no longer feel it. But she did not leave.

-----------------------

7. Suddenly, through snapping branches and whispering winds, there formed a voice -- Frost!“Are you cold, young maiden?”“No, I am quite warm and comfortable,” she replied through chattering teeth.He hissed again, with more demand, “Are you cold, young  maiden?”

-----------------------

8. “I am warm and comfortable, Frost. I am warm and comfortable.”This time, she could feel his voice loud and clear against her ear. “ARE YOU COLD, YOUNG MAIDEN?”Still, she responded, “I am quite warm and comfortable, thank you.”

-------------------------

9. Frost took pity on Marfa. The wind died down and the branches stopped snapping.A beautiful shroud appeared on ther shoulders, lined with fur and intricate patterns.“Thank you very much,” the girl said, and fell comfortably asleep.

----------------------------

10. In the morning, Marfa’s father and stepmother came by to collect the her  body.To the stepmother’s suprise, however, Marfa was much alive and well, surrounded by riches!“See! What did I say? Frost is the richest in all the land! How generous he is,” the stepmother exclaimed.

------------------------------------

11. “If he loved your ugly wench of a daughter, imagine what he’ll think of mine!”That night, the father drove his stepdaughters to the forest. They were to also marry Frost.The two sisters bickered all the way there without end.

------------------------------------

12. “He will only choose one of us! And it will most certainly be me!”“Ha! You? The talentless sister, the one who cannot weave a loom?”“You hideous fool, he will choose me, the one with the prettiest face!”Finally, to the father’s relief, they arrived.

--------------------------------------

13. “You are not to leave, I  will come back to see you in the morning.”The step sisters sat in the cold, shivering. Hours passed by.“Where is he? What’s taking him so long?”“How dare he make us wait  in the freezing snow!”

---------------------------------------

14. Suddenly, through snapping branches and whispering winds, there formed a voice.“Are you cold, young maidens?”“Are we cold? What a foolish question. We cannot feel our own limbs!”The voice hissed again, “Are you cold, young maidens?”

----------------------------------------

15. ”We are waiting for our suitor to bring us gifts, but he is late! I want a golden shroud like Marfa’s!”The voice tried one last time.“ARE YOU COLD, YOUNG MAIDENS?”“Shoo! Leave us be! Be gone with you, old creep!”

-----------------------------------------

16. In the morning, the father and step mother came by to wake the sisters.They were stunned to see the girls were covered by a dirty wool blanket!“Where are all the gifts? Surely he must’ve loved my beautiful daughters,” the step mother wondered. 

---------------------------------------

17. She lifted the blanket and was shocked to find both her daughters frozen solid!Not even harsh Russian Frost wanted the girls. He couldn’t stand their bickering.THE END.
